# Prepare the website

## Slug Strategies

The links and link structure is very important for user experience and search engines.
We need to ensure the search engines understand for which language each page is showing.
And we need to let visitors navigate through one language only, until they actively switch.
The challenge is also about what to do about the homepage i.e. the empty slug

 i.e. what do we show the users when they land on your website www.example.com

To satisfy this constraint. There are two strategies to organize links

### Default Language

This is the recommended strategy considering all the limitations for Squarespace.

The website would be organized as such:

Default language pages (example here for english):
    - www.example.com/
    - www.example.com/services
    - www.example.com/about

Other language pages (example here for french)
    - www.example.com/fr/
    - www.example.com/fr/services
    - www.example.com/fr/a-propos


Benefits:
- no need for a special landing page


Drawbacks:
- more likely to have visitors landing on the homepage which could be the wrong language for them




### No Default Language


This strategy is fine but would not recommend it as you might loose more people on the landing page.
This is how Squarespace recommends setting up multilingual sites manualy

The website would be organized as such:

Landing page:
    - www.example.com/
This landing page would be language agnostic and provide the option for the user to choose a language

Default language pages (example here for english):
    - www.example.com/
    - www.example.com/services
    - www.example.com/about

Other language pages (example here for french)
    - www.example.com/fr/
    - www.example.com/fr/services
    - www.example.com/fr/a-propos






## Remove linked pages

Because the navigation will be handled by the tool. You should remove the linked page navigation.


## Add a menu
