# Guide

## Pre-requisites

- Trial plan or Business plan or higher (there is no way around it because you will need javascript)
- Squarespace version 7.1


## Quick Start and preview

You can follow the [quick start](./1-quick-start.md) to try out this tool in few minutes and see if it works for your needs.
If it does not work, I would super appreciate the feedback. Also happy to help you get set-up. See [contacts](./contact).


## Implementation Steps

There are 3 steps to integrate this:
1. [Prepare the site](./prepare-squarespace-site)
2. [Insert the code] (./insert-code-squarespace-site)
3. [Update the language alternates]


## Why not...?

### Follow Square space suggestion

Squarespace offers [detailed instructions](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/16552875658765-Manually-creating-a-multilingual-site) to manualy create a multilingual website.

Problems:
- You end up with very ugly navigation, either hidden behind a language drop down or all links for all languages crowded and exploded on it
- This is particularly bad on mobile

### Use some code snippet from the internet

Some folks have been very nice to provide some options and code to do something similar.
Truly apperciated. And I was going to use that but...
All the options I found had a flicker because they programmaticaly hide the links. Also not sure how this confuses the search engines.
I could not find a proper language switcher, rather taking the shortcut to link to main pages.
Finaly, these are huge code snippets, only a programmer can read and understand.
There is no community around to ask questions.



### Pay somebody to do it for me

First these services are expensive. They probably use some code as well, do this in 15 min to do it and charge you 100 EUR/USD.
Second, they might do it with all the inconveniences of the other guys's codes. So you need to properly check some demos
Well if all done well I guess it is fine and maybe some providers have more reasonable pricing. But this is a one-off. How do you maintain this after ?


## Why this tool ?


1. It's free. free as in beer and free as in speech. I could not remove the main link distributed here if I wanted to. Once a version is out it is forever cached on the internet. The code is public so anybody could copy it.
2. It's easy to maintain. you should be able to understand and tweak the code even if you know nothing about javascript. I tested this with my wife 
3. There is no flicker and no hidden link. The main navigation is rendered. No links are hidden to confuse the search engines.
4. It has a pre-requisite to have well maintained language alternates for SEO. So you get both user and SEO benefits.
6. You know what you get. Just try the guide. Takes you 5 min to get a quick check. You see if you like it.
7. Support. I will try to solve issues as they come. I made this to help my wife. Your issues allow me to improve the tool and therefore to improve her site as well. Hopefully some other people might join the discussion as well.
